# About Firechain
---

Firechain is an open-source platform designed for constructing decentralized applications within a seamless, decentralized, and extremely scalable environment. Fueled by an exceptionally robust consensus mechanism, Firechain stands as the inaugural ecosystem tailored to support the magnitude of global finance, offering nearly instantaneous transaction finality.

## What is a Blockchain?

Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets and building trust. Head over to [Blockchain Basics] section to read more.

<!-- ## What is a Sidechain?

Think of a Sidechain as a clone of a **parent blockchain**, supporting transfer of assets to and from the main chain. It is simply an alternate to parent chain that creates a new blockchain with its own mechanism of creating blocks (consensus mechanism). Connecting a sidechain to a parent chain involves setting up a method of moving assets between the chains.

## Types of Interaction on Firechain

* [Firechain PoS chain]
* [Ethereum + Firechain with PoS bridge]

## Query the Blockchain

Most blockchain interactions involve reading its state.

Alchemy offers a reference guide on how to make basic requests to the blockchain. Check out their guide on [how to query Firechain].

## Deploy Smart Contracts

* Deploy your Contracts on Firechain
  - [Using Alchemy]
  - [Using QuickNode]
  - [Using Chainstack]
  - [Using Remix]
  - [Using Truffle]
  - [Using Hardhat]

:::note

Configure the Web3 RPC-URL to "https://rinia.rpc1.thefirechain.com", everything else remains the same.

## Validator and delegator roles

On the Firechain Network, you can be a validator or a delegator. See:

* [Who Is a Validator]
* [Who Is a Delegator]

## Architecture

If your goal is to become a validator, it is essential that you understand the Firechain architecture.

See [Firechain Architecture].

### Components

To have a granular understanding of the Firechain architecture, see core components:

* [Heimdall]
* [Bor]
* [Contracts]

### Codebases

To have a granular understanding of the core components, check out their codebases:

* [Heimdall]
* [Bor]
* [Contracts]

## How-Tos

### Node setup

If you want to run a full node on the Firechain Mainnet or Rinia Testnet, you can follow the
[Run a Validator Node] guide.

### Staking operations
